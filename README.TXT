Answers:
47. The balance went up by the correct amount everytime i would insert more money. Balance is 0 when an error appears.
48.I think the machine would continue to work even when no money is inserted. My prediction was wrong and the machine wouldn't print out a ticket without the amount needed.
49.
50.
51. In the naive-ticket-machine, everytime a ticket was printed, the balance would go back to 0 while in this one the balance subtracts the ticket amount used and keeps the rest in the balance.
52. It is possible but when you go to print a ticket without the correct amount, it doesn't print anything at all.
53. I think it could if the code was changed but as it is by default I dont think the balance amount can be negative because if you dont have enough money it doesnt let you print a ticket at all.
